# USV purpose

The USV purpose is to help people edit data, share data, and manage data.

* Edit data by using plain text and any typical text editor.

* Share data by using an international standard for markup.

* Manage data by in ways that work well with spreadsheets and databases.

## Edit data by using plain text and any typical text editor

USV is a plain text format that aims to be easy to read and edit.

* Because USV is plain text, you can use any text editor to open a USV file, edit it, save it, print it, and so on.

* Because USV enables line spacing wherever you want it, you can edit anything from simple unit-oriented data (such as for logs and metrics) all the way up to complex file-oriented data (such as for blog posts and content management).

* Because USV can display marks using your choice of visible symbol characters or invisible control characters, you can edit using your preferred editors and preferred settings for displaying Unicode symbols and Unicode controls.

## Share data by using an international standard for markup

USV has a formal specification on-track to become an international standard.

* Because USV is for worldwide sharing, there is a specification that sets the same marks (such as delimiters) for everyone.

* Because USV provides a formal IETF Internet-Draft, anyone may implement USV in any language, and know that it will work.

* Because USV has a reference implementation that is free libre open source software, everyone can share the tooling as well.

## Manage data by in ways that work well with spreadsheets and databases

USV can manage data collections such as spreadsheet sheets and folios, and database tables and schemas.

* Because USV has units, records, groups, files, and end of transmission, it has more dimensions than CSV, and can even allow for attachments.

* Because USV has more dimensions, it can replace ad hoc binders, such as ZIP files comprising CSV sheets, or XML files comprising Excel workbooks.

* Because USV has jagged array capabilities, it can help save and restore system disk paths, spreadsheet folio tabs, database table names, and more.
