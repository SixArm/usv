# vim notes

vim comes with most modern Linux and BSD distributions.

## Digraph characters

To add digraph characters:

```
digraph rs 9246 us 9247
```

This makes the characters easy to type directly in a .usv file, and easy to to type and read in source code.


## List hidden characters

To list hidden characters:

```
:set list
```

Later:

```
:set nolist
```
