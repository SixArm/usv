# Styles

USV styles can customize various kinds of output so it looks like you prefer.

* Symbols: use full-width symbols, such as "‚êü" for Unit Separator. This is the default.

* Controls: use zero-width controls, such as "\u{001F}" for Unit Separator.

* Braces: use braces, such as "{US}" for Unit Separator.
