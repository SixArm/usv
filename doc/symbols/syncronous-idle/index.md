# Synchronous Idle (SYN)

The Synchronous Idle (SYN) symbol is a heartbeat, and is especially useful for streaming data, such as to keep a connection alive.

* SYN tells the data reader that data streaming is still in progress.

* SYN has no effect on the output content.

Example of a unit that contains a Synchronous Idle:

```usv
a␖b␞
```
