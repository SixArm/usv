## Fundamentally wrong

"Using Unicode graphic characters as metasyntactic escape characters is fundamentally wrong. Those Unicode characters are for displaying the symbols for Unit Separator, Record Separator, etc. and not for actually being separators! ASCII already has those! Included in Unicode!" 

If you like those, use those; I tried those first, and they didn't work well in practice, because they are invisible, and don't copy correctly in many of our tools.


## XKCD one universal standard

"This is like the [XKCD cartoon about one universal standard](https://xkcd.com/927/)."

Ha! That's funny. It turns out USV isn't trying to be one universal standard. CSV works really well for many use cases, and is well-supported everywhere, so keep using it where it works well.

USV aims just for use cases that CSV doesn't seem to handle well, such as text that contains paragraphs of natural language, or data that involves spreadsheet collections (e.g. folios comprising sheets comprising rows and columns) and database collections (e.g. schemas comprising tables comprising records and fields), or data that needs optional streaming capabilities (e.g. synchronous idle heartbeats, end of transmission block terminators).


## You cannot edit it

"You cannot edit it in regular editor, like csv/tsv/jsonlines."

I edit it in regular editors, every day. I personally use vi, emacs, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, all often. I've also tried USV on many more editors, and so far it works 100% of the time. If you have a specific editor that doesn't seem to be working well with USV, can you please contact me?


## No efficient storage

"There is no efficient storage, like binary formats." 

USV is a text format, on purpose, because it's aiming to be human-readable and human-editable. USV storage goals are similar in magnitude to CSV. 

If you want efficient storage like a binary format, one way is to use compression on the text data. USV, CSV. and similar text formats can work well with compression, especially if the content has compression-friendly aspects such as repetitions, sequences, patterns, and so forth.


## There is no wide library support

"There is no wide library support."

Currently there's library support for Rust, which is my preferred programming language for systems work. See the [usv](https://crates.io/crates/usv) and also the command line converter tools [usv-to-csv](https://crates.io/crates/usv-to-csv) and [csv-to-usv](https://crates.io/crates/usv-to-csv).

If you want library support, I welcome help from anyone who wants to develop it. The Rust crate is relatively easy to understand, and should be portable to similar family languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc.


## Not all data is representable 

"Not all data is representable." 

I don't believe that to be true. USV aims to be able to represent all UTF-8 encoded text. USV provides an escape character, so you can escape any of the USV special characters as you wish. 

Can you provide an example of data that is not representable, or an explanation of what the data could be?


## Doesn't work with Excel

"The adoptability challenge remains here to be Excel support."

Yes you're right. USV is brand-new on the standards track in 2024. Excel support is a long-term goal. 

If you have experience with writing Excel import/export capabilities, I welcome your help.


## Not trivially splittable

"I'd avoid most of the escaping they show, especially for line endings, and just make RS '\n' the record separator, or possibly RS '\n'*."

Yes I tried that, and it worked well when the data was grid-oriented, like a spreadsheet with rows and columns, but didn't work well when the data was unit-oriented (such as a list of numbers), or group-oriented (such as a collection of spreadsheet sheets or database tables), or file-oriented (such as a collection of spreadsheet folios or database schemas).


## Nobody needs USV, and nobody should use it.

"This is needlessly adding yet another standard to the mix. If you are in a position to choose what standard you use, just use:

* Whatever is best for the data model and/or languages you use. JSON is a common modern choice, suitable for most things.

* If you want something more tabular, closer to CSV (which is a valid choice for bulk data), use strict RFC 4180 compliant data.

* If you want to specify your own binary super-compact data, use ASN.1. I am also given to understand that Protobuf is a popular modern choice.

If you arenâ€™t in a position to choose your standards, just do whatever you need to do to parse whatever junk you are given, and emit as standards-compliant data as possible as output.

* Again, RFC 4180 is a great way to standardize your own CSV output, as long as you stick to a subset which the receiving party can parse.

Nobody needs USV, and nobody should use it."

Thanks for your specific feedback and conclusion. :-)

For me, what's best for my data model is text (not binary), that handles many human languages using UTF-8 (not ASCII), that is easy to read and edit in many editors (not a specialized row-column editor), and works especially well with content that is paragraphs of natural language with commas, quotes, newlines, indentations, and the like.

For example I've tried binary formats (e.g. ASN.1, Protobuf), row-column tabular formats (e.g. CSV, TDF), web data formats (e.g. JSON, YAML), web markup formats (e.g. HTML, XML).
