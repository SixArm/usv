# Rows of String Values (RSV)

https://github.com/Stenway/RSV-Specification

The RSV data file format is a simple binary alternative to CSV. 

An RSV document represents an array of arrays of nullable string values, also called a jagged array. 

It's main purpose is to store tabular data. But because it's a jagged array, it's not limited to that. So, rows can contain the same number of values, but don't have to.
