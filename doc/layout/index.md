# Layout

USV styles can customize various kinds of output so it looks like you prefer.

* Layout 0: Show each item with no line around it. This is no layout, in other words one long line.

* Layout 1: Show each item with one line around it. This is like single-space lines for long form text.

* Layout 2: Show each item with two lines around it. This is like double-space lines for long form text.

* Layout units: Show each unit on one line. This can be helpful for line-oriented tools.

* Layout records: Show each record on one line. This is like a typical spreadsheet sheet export.

* Layout groups: Show each group on one line. This can be helpful for folio-oriented tools.

* Layout files: Show one file on one line. This can be helpful for archive-oriented tools.
